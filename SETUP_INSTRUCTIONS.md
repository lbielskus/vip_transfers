## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors:
Edit `tailwind.config.ts` - update the `primary` color scheme

### Change Branding:
- App name: Edit `app/layout.tsx` metadata

- PWA name: Edit `public/manifest.json`

### Add Features:
- Payment: Integrate Stripe or PayPal
- Maps: Add Google Maps API for driver tracking
- Notifications: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging
- SMS: Integrate Twilio for text notifications

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security:
- Never commit `.env.local` to Git (it's in .gitignore)
- Update Firestore security rules before production (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
- Keep your Firebase API keys private
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### Performance:
- The app uses server-side rendering by default
- PWA service worker caches assets for offline use
- Images should be optimized before uploading
- Consider using Next.js Image component for optimization

### Testing:
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Test both user and admin roles
- Test booking flow end-to-end
- Test PWA installation on iOS and Android

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "npm install" fails:
- Make sure Node.js is properly installed
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running again
- Check your internet connection

### Firebase errors:
- Double-check your `.env.local` file
- Make sure all Firebase services are enabled
- Check Firebase Console for quota limits

### Build errors:
- Run `npm run lint` to check for errors
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Try deleting `.next` folder and rebuilding

### PWA not installing:
- Must use HTTPS (or localhost for testing)
- Check manifest.json is accessible
- Make sure service worker is registered
- Test in Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest
